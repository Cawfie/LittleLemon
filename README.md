ABSTRACT
Fraud detection in financial transactions aims to identify and prevent unauthorized 
activities to protect financial security and maintain trust. It utilizes techniques like rule-based 
systems, statistical analysis, machine learning, behavioral analytics, and network analysis to 
detect anomalies and predict fraud. Despite challenges such as evolving tactics, false 
positives, and privacy concerns, effective fraud detection is essential for ensuring regulatory 
compliance and reducing financial losses.

Existing Work:
Several frameworks and systems have been implemented in real-world applications. For 
example, credit card companies use machine learning models to analyze transaction data in 
real-time, while banks employ sophisticated fraud detection systems to monitor account 
activities. Additionally, various studies have proposed novel algorithms and techniques to 
address the evolving nature of fraud tactics, the challenge of large data volumes, and the need 
for real-time detection. These efforts aim to create more robust, adaptive, and scalable fraud 
detection systems that can effectively protect financial systems from increasingly 
sophisticated fraudulent activities
